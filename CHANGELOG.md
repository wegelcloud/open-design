## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Plugin & marketplace system — Phase 2A + 1 + 1.5 + 2B + 2C entry slice + 3 (full) + 4 (scaffold / export / publish / atoms doc / library CLI / pipeline-into-startChatRun / bundled atoms / AG-UI adapter / atom-block renderer) + 5 entry slice (docker-compose + Helm values).** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - **`@open-design/agui-adapter` workspace package + `GET /api/runs/:runId/agui`.** Pure-TS bidirectional bridge between OD's native `PersistedAgentEvent` / `GenUIEvent` / `PluginPipelineStageEvent` union and the [AG-UI canonical event protocol](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit). The new SSE endpoint mirrors `/api/runs/:id/events` but pipes every record through `encodeOdEventForAgui` so a CopilotKit / AG-UI client consumes an OD run unmodified. v1 plugins need no change to be consumable inside the AG-UI ecosystem (spec §10.3.5).
  - **`renderActiveStageBlock` + `loadAtomBodies`.** Substrate slice for spec §23.3.2 patch 2: the daemon-side helper reads `<bundled-fsPath>/SKILL.md` for any registered bundled atom and the contracts-side renderer assembles a `## Active stage: <id>` block. The `composeSystemPrompt()` rewiring that consumes them is the next PR; today the helpers are reachable, tested, and the bundled atom plugins from §3.I3 already ship the matching SKILL.md bodies.
  - **Phase 5 Dockerfile + docker-compose + Helm chart entry slice.** `deploy/Dockerfile` now bundles `plugins/_official/` so `registerBundledPlugins()` finds the atom set inside the container. `tools/pack/docker-compose.yml` is the canonical hosted-mode manifest (two-volume layout, OD_API_TOKEN, /api/daemon/status healthcheck). `tools/pack/helm/open-design/` pins the Helm chart parameter surface for the per-cloud value overrides spec §15.5 enumerates; templates land in the Phase 5 follow-up PR.
- **Plugin & marketplace system — earlier landing.** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - **Pipeline runner wired into `POST /api/runs`.** Plugin runs whose snapshot carries `od.pipeline.stages[*]` now emit `pipeline_stage_started` synchronously before the agent process spawns. Subsequent stage events (`pipeline_stage_completed`, per-stage `run_devloop_iterations` audit rows, devloop convergence) fire asynchronously while the agent runs. Stage runner is a converging stub (`critique.score=4`, `preview.ok=true`) so single-pass pipelines walk through every stage in O(stages) time; loop stages still respect `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS`. Errors surface as `pipeline_stage_failed` events and never block the agent. **e2e-3** flips from entry-slice to the full §8 contract: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-headless-run.test.ts` asserts the first SSE event on a pipeline-bearing plugin run is `pipeline_stage_started`.
  - **`od doctor`.** Repo-wide diagnostics: daemon status, installed-plugin doctor sweep, library inventory (skills / design-systems / atoms / craft). Exits 1 when any plugin doctor returns ok=false; exit 64 when the daemon is unreachable.
  - **`od config get/set/list/unset`.** Wraps `GET/PUT /api/app-config`. Top-level keys via positional or `--value`; nested values via `--value-json`.
  - **Phase 4 / §23 entry slice — bundled atom plugins.** New `plugins/_official/atoms/{discovery-question-form,todo-write,direction-picker,critique-theater}/{SKILL.md,open-design.json}` pairs, plus a daemon boot walker (`apps/daemon/src/plugins/bundled.ts`) that registers each folder under `source_kind='bundled'` / `trust='bundled'` on every startup. Idempotent (upserts), ENOENT-silent (works outside the dev tree). Lays the substrate for the §23.3.2 patch that lifts prompt fragments out of `system.ts`.
- **Plugin & marketplace system — Phase 2A + 1 + 1.5 + 2B + 2C entry slice + 3 (full) + 4 (scaffold / export / publish / atoms doc / library CLI) + early 5 (earlier landing).** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - **Phase 4 publish.** `od plugin publish <id> --to anthropics-skills|awesome-agent-skills|clawhub|skills-sh [--repo <github>] [--open]` builds the catalog submission URL + PR body and (with `--open`) auto-launches the system browser. The author still goes through the upstream review flow; OD never POSTs anywhere.
  - **CLI parity remainder.** `od atoms list/show`, `od skills list/show`, `od design-systems list/show`, `od craft list/show`, `od status`, `od version`. New HTTP routes `GET /api/craft` + `GET /api/craft/:id` walk the `craft/` directory and return `{ id, label, bytes }` summaries.
  - **`od marketplace search "<query>" [--tag <tag>]`.** Substring match over every configured marketplace's `plugins[]`; powered entirely by the catalog metadata `od marketplace add` already cached, so a code agent can discover plugins without being inside the desktop UI.
- **Plugin & marketplace system — Phase 2A + 1 + 1.5 + 2B (composer mount + marketplace deep UI) + 2C entry slice + 3 entry slice + 4 (scaffold / export / atoms doc) + early 5 (earlier landing).** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - **Phase 4 author tooling.** `od plugin scaffold --id <id>` writes a starter SKILL.md + open-design.json + README.md (optionally a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). `od plugin export <projectId> --as od|claude-plugin|agent-skill --out <dir>` materialises a publish-ready folder from the AppliedPluginSnapshot behind a project (or a snapshot id), so any chat that ran a plugin can be re-published to anthropics/skills, awesome-agent-skills, clawhub, or skills.sh without leaving the terminal. The output's open-design.json carries a provenance block (snapshotId + manifestSourceDigest + appliedAt) that reverse-resolves to the originating run.
  - **Phase 2B marketplace deep UI.** New routes `/marketplace` and `/marketplace/<pluginId>` rendered by `MarketplaceView` (catalog grid + trust filters + configured catalogs panel) and `PluginDetailView` (manifest, capability checklist, connector requirements, declared GenUI surfaces, "Use this plugin" → applyPlugin → Home). `/plugins/<id>` is a parsed alias so the public-site URL scheme reserved in spec §13 already works in-app.
  - **Phase 2B ChatComposer mount.** `ChatComposer` renders `<PluginsSection variant="strip" />` above the input whenever a `projectId` is known. Apply hydrates the draft only when empty so a mid-typing user is never overwritten.
  - **`docs/atoms.md`.** New canonical reference for the first-party atom catalog: implemented vs planned ids, task-kind mapping, how the daemon resolves an atom at run time, the closed `until`-signal vocabulary, and the §22.5 community-plugin → first-party-atom promotion path.
- **Plugin & marketplace system — Phase 2A finished + Phase 1 follow-up + Phase 1.5 + Phase 2B (composer mount) + Phase 2C entry slice + Phase 3 entry slice + early Phase 5 (earlier landing).** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - **CLI canonical agent-facing API (spec §11.7).** Every UI action now has a CLI equivalent: `od project create/list/info/delete`, `od run start/watch/cancel/list/info` (with `--plugin`, `--inputs`, `--grant-caps`, `--snapshot-id`, `--follow`), `od files list/read/write/upload/delete`, `od conversation list/info`. Plugin runs route through the §3.A1 snapshot resolver.
  - **Phase 1.5 headless lifecycle.** New `od daemon start [--headless] [--serve-web] [--port] [--host] [--namespace]`, `od daemon status [--json]`, `od daemon stop`. Backed by new HTTP routes `GET /api/daemon/status` and `POST /api/daemon/shutdown` (loopback-only). The default `od` (no subcommand) keeps its desktop behaviour for back-compat. e2e-3's headless install→project→run loop is now anchored in a daemon supertest (`apps/daemon/tests/plugins-headless-run.test.ts`).
  - **Phase 3 marketplace plugin install resolution.** `POST /api/plugins/install` with a bare plugin name walks every configured `plugin_marketplaces` row in registration order and re-routes to the canonical `github:…` / `https://…` source recorded in the matched manifest. CLI: `od plugin install <name>` works against any catalog the operator added via `od marketplace add <url>`.
  - **Web composer mount.** New `PluginsSection` widget combines `InlinePluginsRail`, `ContextChipStrip`, `PluginInputsForm`, plus `renderPluginBriefTemplate`'s `{{var}}` substitution. Mounted in `NewProjectPanel` below the project-name input as the Phase 2A discovery surface. Purely additive: the existing Send button rules are unchanged.
  - The earlier work in this changelog block remains in place (snapshot resolver, trust mutation, connector tool-token gate, fallback rejection, GitHub tarball + HTTPS install sources, pipeline runner with cross-conversation cache, marketplace registry, snapshot GC worker, web component primitives, definition-of-done suite, …).
- **Plugin & marketplace system — Phase 2A → entry slice of Phase 2B/2C/3 (earlier landing).** Spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](docs/plugins-spec.md). Living plan: [`docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md`](docs/plans/plugins-implementation.md).
  - Snapshot resolver wires `applyPlugin()` into `POST /api/projects` and `POST /api/runs`. Capability gate failures map to HTTP 409 / exit 66; missing inputs map to HTTP 422 / exit 67. The in-memory run object carries `appliedPluginSnapshotId` so connector / replay paths read a frozen view.
  - Trust mutation: new `POST /api/plugins/:id/trust` endpoint plus matching `od plugin trust <id> --capabilities …` CLI. Validates the spec §5.3 capability vocabulary (rejects unknown / malformed strings); preserves the implicit `prompt:inject` floor on revoke.
  - Connector tool-token gate: tokens minted for plugin runs carry `pluginSnapshotId` / `pluginTrust` / `pluginCapabilitiesGranted`. `/api/tools/connectors/execute` re-validates the §5.3 `connector:<id>` rule per call (CONNECTOR_NOT_GRANTED 403 on miss). Trusted plugins implicitly carry `connector:*`; restricted plugins must list each id explicitly.
  - API-fallback rejection: every `/api/proxy/*` entry returns 409 PLUGIN_REQUIRES_DAEMON when a body smuggles `pluginId` / `appliedPluginSnapshotId`.
  - Snapshot GC worker enforces the PB2 `expires_at` TTL (`OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` / `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS`) at boot + on a periodic interval. Operator escape hatch: `od plugin snapshots prune --before <ts>`.
  - Installer accepts `github:owner/repo[@ref][/subpath]` (codeload tarball) and `https://*.tar.gz` archives in addition to local folders. Hard guards: symlink / hard-link rejection, path-traversal segments, 50 MiB size cap.
  - Pipeline runner emits `pipeline_stage_*` events per stage and persists every iteration into `run_devloop_iterations`. Pre-stage GenUI surfaces auto-derived for not-yet-connected required connectors hit the cross-conversation cache (e2e-5: a second conversation in the same project never re-broadcasts an already-resolved `oauth-prompt`).
  - Marketplace registry minimum verbs: `od marketplace add/list/info/refresh/remove/trust` plus the matching HTTP routes. Default trust tier is `restricted` per spec §9; the Phase 3 follow-up wires `od plugin install <name>` resolution + the trust UI.
  - Web composer surface: `applyPlugin()` state helper, `InlinePluginsRail`, `ContextChipStrip`, `PluginInputsForm`, `GenUISurfaceRenderer` (confirmation + oauth-prompt first-class; form / choice fall back to a JSON Schema preview until Phase 2A.5), `GenUIInbox` drawer.
  - `od plugin run` apply→start shorthand. CLI structured error helper maps recoverable HTTP 4xx envelopes to the §12.4 exit codes (64–73) so code agents get a stable retry contract.
  - Plan §8 e2es covered at the daemon level: e2e-2 (pure apply across runs), e2e-4 (replay invariance after plugin upgrade via `renderPluginBlock(snapshot)`), e2e-5 (GenUI cross-conversation cache), e2e-6 (connector trust gate; re-validated independently in the token-issuance + execute routes), e2e-7 (API-fallback rejection at every proxy entry), e2e-8 (apply purity regression: 100 applies → 0 FS mutation, +100 snapshot rows). e2e-3 (headless run) stays scheduled for Phase 1.5.
- **`ib-pitch-book` skill** — investment-banking strategic-alternatives pitch book (Anthropic financial-services Pitch Agent workflow); ships `example.html` and IB layout references.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-07

A minor release focused on iteration: live-data dashboards graduate to a first-class artifact category, an in-preview Inspect mode lands for per-element style tuning, the desktop launcher gets an accent color theme, Critique Theater advances to Phase 5, and Linux gains headless lifecycle support.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-05

A multi-protocol leap: Open Design now ships as an MCP server, ships Critique Theater (Design Jury) Phase 4, gains live-reload + Tweaks mode + live artifacts in the preview pane, and adds five new agent / runtime adapters. 71 merged PRs from 40+ contributors over two days. Linux AppImage packaging landed in tooling, but the stable Linux artifact is deferred from 0.4.0 while containerized release packaging is hardened.

### Added

#### MCP & agent integration
- **`od mcp` — expose Open Design as a stdio MCP server.** Coding agents in other repos (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity, Zed, Windsurf) can read files from local Open Design projects directly, including the project the user has open in the Open Design app right now. ([#399])
- **Link code folder support for agent context** — point agents at any local code folder alongside the design project. ([#455])
- Kilo CLI (ACP) agent adapter. ([#480])
- DeepSeek TUI agent adapter. ([#439])

#### Critique workflow
- **Critique Theater Phase 4** — persistence, transcript, and orchestrator. The "Design Jury" multi-panelist scoring pipeline is now end-to-end. ([#481])
